Problem Statement

Managing daily tasks becomes difficult
when tasks are not organized, often 
leading to missed deadlines or 
forgotten work. There is a need for a
simple tool that allows users to store
, view, delete, and save tasks easily.
This project aims to create a 
command-line Task Manager in Python
that helps users efficiently manage
their to-do items by adding tasks, 
displaying the list, deleting tasks,
and saving or loading tasks from a file.

 
A simple command-line To-Do List
Application built using Python.
This project helps users add, 
view, delete, save, and load tasks
using lists and file handling.
